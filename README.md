   # macOS/Linux
   ./start.sh
   ```

The script will:

- ✅ Create an isolated virtual environment

## CLI (Command Line)

For terminal enthusiasts who prefer the classic interface:

1. **Create virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv

   # Activate it:
   source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run PDFGrabber CLI:**

   ```bash
   python3 main.py  # macOS/Linux
   python main.py   # Windows
   ```

4. **Using the CLI:**
   - Press `r`: Register a new profile
   - Press `d`: Download a book
   - Downloaded files: `files/<service>/<book name>.pdf`

**Why Virtual Environment?**

- ✅ No dependency conflicts with other Python projects
- ✅ Isolated environment with only required packages
- ✅ Easy to remove (just delete the `venv` folder)
- ✅ No admin/sudo rights needed
